# NAME

runtests - Find tests and run them in Perl's harness via \`*dispatch*'


# SYNOPSIS

*runtests*\ [**OPTION(s)**...]

Within \`*cmake*' that might look like this:

    add_custom_target(
      test
      /bin/sh ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/test-detach/runtests
                  -source-dir ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}
                  -binary-dir ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}
      WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/tests)


# DESCRIPTION

While \`*dispatch*' runs tests in a controlled and tunable environment,
\`*runtests*' uses \`*find*(1)' to gather a list of test scripts and feeds them
into Perl's \`*prove*(1)' harness with an appropriate set of options. It also
makes sure, that \`*prove*' uses \`*dispatch*' to actually call the test
scripts, thus making sure that test scripts written in multiple languages run
within the same harness.


# OPTIONS

**-binary-dir DIR**

:   The projects binary directory root. Defauls the the value of the
    \`*-source-dir*' option.

**-source-dir DIR**

:   The projects source directory root. Defaults to \`*\$PWD*' if unspecified.

**-dispatch FILE**

:   Path name of \`*dispatch*' script. Defaults to
    \`//\<source-dir\>/test-dispatch/dispatch//'

**-dispatch-root DIR**

:   Specifies the root directory of the test-tree. Default:
    \`*\<source-dir\>/test*'

**-dispatch-bin-root DIR**

:   Specifies the root directory of the binary test-tree. Default:
    \`*\<binary-dir\>/test*'

**-export VARIABLE VALUE**

:   Adds the variable \`*VARIABLE*' with the value \`*VALUE*' to the
    environment of all children of the \`*untests*'.

**-strip-roots**

:   Strip \`*DISPATCH\_ROOT*' and *DISPATCH\_BIN\_ROOT* from a test's
    filename before feeding it into \`*dispatch*'. This option may be used
    for cosmetic purposes, for example in case absolute path-names are used
    and the working directory is known.

**-dispatch-verbose**

:   Turns on verbosity in the \`*dispatch*' script.

**-verbose**

:   Turns on verbosity in Perl's \`*prove*' TAP harness.

**-debug**

:   Turns on debugging output within the \`*runtests*' script.
